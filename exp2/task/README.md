Cues and Memory PsychoPy Program

This contains the experimental program and stimuli for the Cues and Memory study exp 2 (online). 

Study Phase:
In the study phase, participants are presented with words and cued to make 1 of 2 judgments (shoebox or manmade). This task is cued by the color of a square prior to a word (informed trials) or by the color a box around the word (uninformed trials). A red color indicates a shoebox judgment, whereas a blue color indicates a manmade judgment.  Words are presented briefly on the screen along with the judgment cue below each word. This was a blocked design (ABBA/BAAB) with A-informed and B-uninformed/uncued. Four stimuli lists were created and participants were randomly assigned to a stimuli list and counterbalance (ABBA/BAAB).

Test Phase:
In the test phase, participants make memory judgments about the words. Responses are made using a 6-point confidence scale (6-sure old, 5-maybe old, 4-guess old, 3-guess new, 2-maybe new, 1-sure new). For words that received an old response (6,5,4), participants made a source memory judgment (4 shoebox, 5 manmade,  6 dont know). Participants made mouse button clicks on the ratings scale. There is a brief pause before the next trial and they took 4 short breaks. A termination link redirects participants to the previously used prolific study which is no longer active.

Data are stored in the 'data' folder following the BIDS format (for behavioral data with no neuroimaging data). In the case of computer crashes or data storage failure, the 'archive' folder will create a combined data file for all tasks. 
The html folder is required to run this task online through prolofic and contains the resources (e.g., instructions, files) that are downloaded to the web browser. It also contains the corresponding javascript files for this task that are needed to run online. Note, this task is modified to work online so may need to change task settings to work on a local computer (see psychopy documentation for further information).

Note: In this task, uninformed trials/files/instructions should be considered conceptually as uncued/no cue trials.
