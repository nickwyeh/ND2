Cues and Memory PsychoPy Program

This contains the experimental program and stimuli for the Cues and Memory exp 1. 

Study Phase:
In the study phase, participants are presented with words and cued to make 1 of 2 judgments (shoebox or manmade). This task is cued by the color of a circle prior to a word (informed trials) or by the font color of the word (non-informed trials). A red color indicates a shoebox judgment, whereas a blue color indicates a manmade judgment. Words are presented briefly on the screen along with the judgment cue below each word. The word on informed trials appears in a white font, and the circle is presented in white on non-informed trials. Breaks are given every 64 trials. 

Make sure to emphasize speed in this phase. Shoebox responses should be made with the left hand (f-yes, d-no) and manmade responses should be made with the right hand (j-yes, k-no).

Test Phase:
In the test phase, participants make memory judgments about the words. Responses are made using a 6-point confidence scale (S-sure old, D-maybe old, F-guess old, J-guess new, K-maybe new, L-sure new). The letter corresponds to the keyboard press, but the responses are coded 6-1 respectively. There is a brief pause before the next trial. 

Data are stored in the 'data' folder following the BIDS format (for behavioral data with no neuroimaging data). In the case of computer crashes or data storage failure, the 'archive' folder will create a combined data file for all tasks.
