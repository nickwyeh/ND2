#### The scripts need to be run in order: organization script (Part1) -> quality control script (Part2) -> analyses script (Part3). 
Note, the orginzation script pulls data from source data and outputs data to the raw data folder. The quality control script pulls from the raw data and outputs to data files folder. The analyses script will require the ROC toolbox (see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27573007/). 
The individual scripts contain additional details.
