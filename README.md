## ND2 consisted of 4 pre-registered experiments that investigated the relationship between prestimulus cues and memory. For preregistrations see https://osf.io/ydmun/.
##### Task overview:
* The computer-based tasks were built in psychopy (https://www.psychopy.org/) with Experiments 2-4 being host online (https://pavlovia.org/). Each task consisted of a study and test phase. 
* The study phase varied slightly across experiments, but the general design had individuals make one of two semantic judgments about a list of words in either a informed, uninformed or no cue condition. For details see readme files associated with each experiment.<p align = "center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/ND2/blob/main/figures/nd2.png" height = "200" width="600"> </p> 
* The test phase also varied slightly with participants memory for the list of words and the condition they were presented in (i.e., informed, uninformed, or no cue condition). Currently the data is not public as the study is ongoing.


 ##### Directory structure overview:
* An example of the directory/folder structure is depicted below. Note, this follows the principals from the brain imaging data structure (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Briefly this repo contains 4 experiments with the individual tasks and data files nested within each experiment.  <p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/ND2/blob/main/figures/data_structure.png" width="400">  </p>
