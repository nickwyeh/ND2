## ND2 consisted of 4 pre-registered experiments that investigated the relationship between prestimulus cues and memory. For preregistrations see https://osf.io/ydmun/.
 ##### Folder structure overview:
* An example of the repo structure is depicted below. Note, the structure mostly follows the brain imaging data structure (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Briefly this repo contains 4 experiment folders with the individual tasks and data files nested within each experiment.  <p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/ND2/blob/main/figures/data_structure.png" width="400">  </p>
 ##### 
* The computer-based experimental tasks were built in psychopy (https://www.psychopy.org/) with experiments 2-4 being host online (https://pavlovia.org/). Each task consisted of a study and test phase. Currently the data is not public as the study is ongoing.
