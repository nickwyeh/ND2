Cues and Memory PsychoPy Program

This contains the experimental program and stimuli for the Cues and Memory study exp 3. 

Study Phase:
In the study phase, participants are presented with words and cued to make 1 of 2 judgments (shoebox or manmade). In the informed trials, a red or blue square cues indicates the semantic judgments to make about words presented in white text encosed in a white box In the uninformed trials, a white square cue is presented and the word is presented in white text enclosed in a red or blue box which indicates the semantic judgment to make. In the uncued/no cue trials, participants receive no cue and the word is presented in white text and is enclosed in a red or blue box which indicates the semantic judgment to make. A red color indicates a shoebox judgment, whereas a blue color indicates a manmade judgment.  Words are presented briefly on the screen along with the judgment cue below each word. This was a blocked design (ABCCBA/BCAACB/CABBAC) with A-informed, B-uninformed, C-uncued/no cue. Four stimuli lists were created and participants were randomly assigned to a stimuli list and counterbalance condition.

Test Phase:
In the test phase, participants make memory judgments about the words. Responses are made using a 6-point confidence scale (6-sure old, 5-maybe old, 4-guess old, 3-guess new, 2-maybe new, 1-sure new). For words that received an old response (6,5,4), participants made a source memory judgment (4 shoebox, 5 manmade,  6 dont know). Participants made mouse button clicks on the ratings scale. There is a brief pause before the next trial and they took 4 short breaks. A termination link redirects participants to the previously used prolific study which is no longer active.

Data are stored in the 'data' folder following the BIDS format (for behavioral data with no neuroimaging data). In the case of computer crashes or data storage failure, the 'archive' folder will create a combined data file for all tasks. 
The HTML folder is required for running the study online through the web and has the corresponding javascript for the program and resources folder that needs to be downloaded to the web browser. 
Note, this task is meant to be run online and may not function properly when run locally, see psychopy documentation for differences in running locally vs online.
